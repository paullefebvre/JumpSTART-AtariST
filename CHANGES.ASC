                               JumpSTART
                               
                            by Paul Lefebvre

   VERSION 2.0  February 13, 1992
     - First public release

   VERSION 2.1   March 3, 1992
     - JumpSTART can now be an installed application.

     - JMP files can be instantly loaded.

     - NeoDesk 3 icon added to LZH


   VERSION 2.2   March 8, 1992
     - Instant loading of JMP files is now allowed from any drive and
       directory, not just the JumpSTART directory

     - Clicking JumpSTART 2 title box brings up address information
       *** Suggested by Larry Lefebvre ***
       
     - Improved directory handling so that JumpSTART remembers the last
       directory accessed when ADDing files


   VERSION 2.3   April 2, 1992
     - Replaced Personal Pascal 'chain' command with pexec.  Results in
       better parameter passing to programs.

     - Personal Pascal showm command replaced with a LineA show mouse
       call that works much better.

     - The file description is displayed at the top of the screen after
       selecting a program. (Previously the file path was shown.)

     - A different method is used to clear the screen, allows Quick ST
       custom backgrounds to remain intact.


   VERSION 2.4   April 3, 1992
      - The title box is cleared out if a JMP file without a title is
        loaded.

      - When a TOS program is run, the mouse is hidden, the screen is
        cleared, and the cursor is shown.

      - The disk title can no longer overwrite the Quit button in the 
        RUN ONLY dialog.

      - When Load or Save is selected, the file selector opens to the
        directory JumpSTART was loaded from.

      - If JumpSTART doesn't find a JMP file when it is loaded, it skips
        the 'JMP file not found' message.
        

   VERSION 2.5   April 4, 1992
      - The Config button has been replaced with a Clear button.  This
        button will instantly clear the JMP file that is in memory.

      - A 'close' button has been added to the top left of the file
        descriptions box.  Every JMP file that is loaded is now memorized
        by JumpSTART.  Pressing the 'close' button displays the previous
        JMP file.  Up to 10 JMP files may be memorized.

      - The Read A: button has been replaced with a Re-Read button.  This
        button works as it did before for floppy users, but it allows
        hard drive users to reload the JMP file that was loaded when
        JumpSTART was run.  Re-Read will always clear the list of memorized
        JMP file lists.

      - Code size has been reduced.  Version 2.5 is actually smaller than
        any of the previous versions.


   VERSION 2.51   June 14, 1992
      - Linked with newest versions of the Personal Pascal libraries.

      - Fixed a bug where the Save button was not deselected every time a
        new JMP file was loaded.

      - When Saving a file, the current JMP filename appears in the file
        selector's Selection line.


   VERSION 2.52   June 20, 1992
      - Resource file has been enlarged to include a separate dialog for
        medium resolution that is much easier to read.  Also, the high
        resolution dialog has been expanded as well as some minor
        modifications to the low resolution dialog.
        

   VERSION 2.6    June 21, 1992
      - New file descriptions are displayed without redrawing the entire
        dialog.  Makes JumpSTART faster and easier to use.
      - A small bug in the parameter passing was fixed.
      - A 'Press any key to continue :' message is displayed after running
        TOS programs.
      - The Desk menu title no longer appears in low res.  (Since it
        couldn't be accessed anyway)
      - The page up/down buttons now will wrap around if there is more
        than one page of text.  (i.e. Click on the up button while on
        page 3 will take you to page 1)


   VERSION 2.61    July 2, 1992
      - A complete screen redraw is no longer done when a file is removed.
      - Radio buttons won't get messed up if Run was not selected when
        the close button is pushed or when Load is selected.
      - JumpSTART title is now correctly displayed after instant-loading
        a JMP file.

   VERSION 2.7     July 11, 1992
      - Several minor bugs that were introduced in version 2.6 have been
        fixed.
      - The Load button now serves two functions :
        1.) It will load a JMP file as before.
        2.) It allows a program that is not installed in the
            filelist to be run.
        *** Suggested by Neil Harding ***
        
      - Filelist sorting is now user-controlled.  The Sort button allows
        the user to specify if the filelist is to be sorted.  If it is
        selected the filelist will be sorted.
        When a filelist is saved, the status of the sort button is also
        saved.  When the filelist is loaded, the sort button is reset to
        the saved status.  This allows you to have some JMP filelists that
        are sorted and some that are not.  When files are Added, the sort
        button will determine if the files will be placed at the end of the
        list (unsorted) or put in the correct place (sorted).
        *** Inadvertently suggested by Al Fasoldt ***
        
      - JumpSTART can now run your favorite text file viewer when a
        non-program file is selected from the Load button.  To use this
        feature, create a one line text file called JUMPST2.DAT that has
        the complete pathname (in caps) of your text file viewer.  When you
        select Load from JumpSTART, select a text file with the file
        selector and JumpSTART will pass its name to the text file viewer.
        *** Suggested by Larry Lefebvre ***
        
      - This should be the last version, barring any other minor bug
        fixes.  (Unless I get overwhelmed with responses from people
        using this program!)

   VERSION 2.72  August 6, 1992
      
      - Fixes a small bug in 2.7 : A JMP file with only one file
        description will now load correctly.
        
      - Dialog boxes are now shadowed (instead of outlined) added code to
        accomplish this,since the stand Do_Dialog call would only draw an
        outlined box.
        
      - The sort button will now immediatly sort the file in memory if
        selected.

      - JumpSTART has now been verified to work on :
           1040STe
           Mega STe
           TT030     (TT Medium and TT High.  The colors are messed up in
                      TT Medium, but I do not know why.  Any help would be
                      appreciated.)

   VERSION 2.73  October 6, 1992

      - Fixed a bug that stopped JumpSTART from working in low-res.

      - When saving to a floppy, the directory line is now displayed
        correctly.

      - Added the wind_new call for the benefit of people using TOS 1.4
        or higher.  1st Word Plus and Word Writer and ST Logo will now
        work correctly for users with TOS 1.4 or up.

   VERSION 2.73a May 15, 1993

      - The screen is _always_ cleared for TOS & TTP programs.

      - Other minor bug fixes.

     Known Problems :
        - 1st Word Plus, Word Writer ST don't remove their function key
          boxes from the screen.  Causes problems when other programs
          are loaded. ( Only with TOS 1.0 and TOS 1.2 )
        - Programs that do not close their own windows upon exiting are
          erratic(ST Logo).  Code has been added to try and close them manually,
          but it does not appear to work all of the time. ( Only with
          TOS 1.0 and TOS 1.2 )
        - If you are using an accessory that uses a window, do not return to
          JumpSTART without first making sure you close the window or else
          problems will arise.
